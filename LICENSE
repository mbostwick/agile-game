did you actually read all of this ? How many times have you had to interact with a lawyer ? How much did they charge you?
If you didn't know anyone who touches this or even looks at this can be forced to go to court about it.
If you touched this or even looked at this the lawyers are going to get you. If you don't think so create a branch.
If you did not create a branch and read this, you can't say you couldn't have changed it.
If you read terms of service on websites they say this, because they have lawyers who are paid lots of money.
This really could be improved but lets be honest, no one cares..

## Overview
- In talking with friends sometimes conversation about agile happen.
- A developer said no one really knows what agile is, so it can be a bit of a game.
- Everyone agrees to be agile, you must iterate quickly. As such `node run iterate-quickly.js`

## Problems
- you dont have node
  - first look up the word orgin which is: early 15c., "a knot or lump," from Latin nodus "knot" (from PIE root *ned- "to bind, tie"). Originally borrowed c. 1400 in Latin form, meaning "lump in the flesh." Meaning "point of intersection" (originally in astronomy, of planetary orbits with the ecliptic) is recorded from 1660s.
  - Next ask Ryan Dahl why he doesn't like the apache web server
  - If after completing the first to steps, learn how to install software
  - If this fails, get paper from a tree, and cut punch holes carefully, then take a picture and create a `git branch`.
- Adding c# to this game seemed like more work then just using node..

## Things Someone Should Do
- Maybe prompt for what the issue that is happening is and make a text suggestion ? 
- Maybe add [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) and have fun..
- add stuff here, but who is really going to create a branch ? 
- test things ? I mean I feel like this game is a test..
